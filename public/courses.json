    "body": "<p>In this first introduction to Calculus, students will be introduced to the tools of differential calculus, the branch of calculus that is motivated by the problem of measuring how quantities change. Students will use these tools to solve other problems, including simplifying functions with straight lines, describing how different types of change are related, and computing maximum and minimum quantities. This course will focus on developing a deep understanding of why the tools of calculus make sense and how to apply them to the social, biological, and physical sciences. It will also emphasize translating between algebraic, graphical, numerical and verbal descriptions of each concept studied. This course will be useful for students interested in learning applied calculus in relation to future studies in economics, life science, and physical and mathematical science programs. </p>",
